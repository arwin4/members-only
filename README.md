#### Simple message board with authentication and privileges

This is an implementation of [The Odin Project's Members Only project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-members-only). It is a message board with account creation and authentication, giving users different privileges:

- Only logged in users can see message contents and author.
- Only members can post.
- Only admins can delete messages.

Please note that the [live deployment](https://members-only-9prd.onrender.com) may take up to a minute to spin back up.

This project has minimal CSS, because it was mostly meant to practice
authentication and database management.
